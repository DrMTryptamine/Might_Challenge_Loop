# Might_Challenge_Loop

v1.1 - I noticed during some testing, the special fight loop repeats were a little bit off. By a little bit i mean, it was hours and days worth of special fighting. I re-calculated and adjusted the repeat amounts to fit the delays of the skills used. It should work fine now.

; Script created using AutoHotKey ; In the BUILD-Create screen Create clones if not max: ON ; Auto-buy missing creations OFF ; In the BUILD-Monuments screen Stop after finish: OFF ; Auto-buy missing creations ON ; In the GOD POINTS screen Boni can be in MYSTIC or NOTHING

If these criteria are not met, the script will not function properly

The timings in this script are set for 500k clones - 30 CC - 4380 bs - 2275 cs
Press backspace to STOP
Press Shift+P to PAUSE

I am working on compiling all of these scripts into one working bot with a neat GUI. 
Currently i'm making the body of the scripts using timed pauses, that work with my current game. There are still a few more to come like this. I am working on creating the variables to start including functions and IF statements. 
[Enter clones] + [Enter BS] + [Enter CC] + [Enter CS] = set time to x
